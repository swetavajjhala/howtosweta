# How To Sweta

_Heavily inspired by [How To Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/)_

##### Purpose of this document

Hello and welcome to the team! I am so excited to have you on board. It will take some time to ramp up on all things $COMPANY and get to know how things operate around here. During this time, one of the working relationships we'll need to define is ours.

The purpose of this document is to make clear what you can expect from me, and some baseline expectations I will have for you. It will also give some insight into my management philosophy and some driving principals. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

This document does NOT:
* Replace any career architecture or progression documents at $COMPANY
* Have anything related to my plans for the organization and its product
* Apply to any other manager at $COMPANY.

Please note that this is a [living, breathing document](https://github.com/swetavajjhala/howtosweta/blob/master/howtosweta.md) - as such, I plan to update it frequently and would truly appreciate your feedback.
