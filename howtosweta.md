# How To Sweta

_Heavily inspired by [How To Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/)_

##### Purpose of this document

Hello and welcome to the team! I am so excited to have you on board. It will take some time to ramp up on all things $COMPANY and get to know how things operate around here. During this time, one of the working relationships we'll need to define is ours.

The purpose of this document is to make clear what you can expect from me, and some baseline expectations I will have for you. It will also give some insight into my management philosophy and some driving principals. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

This document does NOT:
* Replace any career architecture or progression documents at $COMPANY
* Have anything related to my plans for the organization and its products

Please note that this is a [living, breathing document](https://github.com/swetavajjhala/howtosweta/edit/master/howtosweta.md) - as such, I plan to update it frequently and would truly appreciate your feedback.


## What You Can Expect From Me


#### I will "show up" to work every day
Every day, I will bring my whole self to work. What does this mean?


#### You can reach me in the following ways
If you have a question that does not need a response within 48 hours, you can leave me a Slack direct message (DM). I will respond by end of the week.

If you need to discuss something that needs a response within 48 hours, send me an email - I will respond within 24 hours.

If you need to discuss a topic that needs immediate attend, page, text or call me. This should only be used in most dire of circumstances.

## What I Expect From You

#### You will "show up" to work every day
I expect that you will do the same. If, for some reason, you are not able to do this, I expect that you will communicate this to me, so we can work out a schedule that makes sense.
